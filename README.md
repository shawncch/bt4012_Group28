# Group28: Fraudulent Transaction Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training to identify fraudulent behavior in transactional data.

## Project Structure

- `Group28_BT4012_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis of the dataset.
- `Group28_BT4012_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing, training, validating, and testing machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactional data with features related to customer behavior, transaction details, and metadata. The target variable is `Is Fraudulent`, which indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment and install dependencies, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can verify your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

## Install dependencies

After download, make sure that you install all required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Verify the installation
```bash
pip list
```

## Running the project

You can launch Jupyter Notebook using:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
